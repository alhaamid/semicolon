					<p>A <em>jamcoin</em> is a string of <strong>N</strong> &ge; 2 digits with the following properties:</p>
					<ul>
					<li>Every digit is either <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>.</li>
					<li>The first digit is <code>1</code> and the last digit is <code>1</code>.</li>
					<li>If you interpret the string in any base between 2 and 10, inclusive, the resulting number is not prime.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Not every string of <code>0</code>s and <code>1</code>s is a jamcoin. For example, <code>101</code> is not a jamcoin; its interpretation in base 2 is 5, which is prime. But the string <code>1001</code> is a jamcoin: in bases 2 through 10, its interpretation is 9, 28, 65, 126, 217, 344, 513, 730, and 1001, respectively, and none of those is prime.</p>
					<p>We hear that there may be communities that use jamcoins as a form of currency. When sending someone a jamcoin, it is polite to prove that the jamcoin is legitimate by including a nontrivial divisor of that jamcoin's interpretation in each base from 2 to 10. (A nontrivial divisor for a positive integer <em>K</em> is some positive integer other than 1 or <em>K</em> that evenly divides <em>K</em>.) For convenience, these divisors must be expressed in base 10.</p>
					<p>For example, for the jamcoin <code>1001</code> mentioned above, a possible set of nontrivial divisors for the base 2 through 10 interpretations of the jamcoin would be: 3, 7, 5, 6, 31, 8, 27, 5, and 77, respectively.</p>
					<p>Can you produce <strong>J</strong> different jamcoins of length <strong>N</strong>, along with proof that they are legitimate?</p>
					<h3>Input</h3>
					<p>The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, <strong>T</strong>. <strong>T</strong> test cases follow; each consists of one line with two integers <strong>N</strong> and <strong>J</strong>.</p>
					<h3>Output</h3>
					<p>For each test case, output <strong>J</strong>+1 lines. The first line must consist of only <code>Case #x:</code>, where <code>x</code> is the test case number (starting from 1). Each of the last <strong>J</strong> lines must consist of a jamcoin of length <strong>N</strong> followed by nine integers. The i-th of those nine integers (counting starting from 1) must be a nontrivial divisor of the jamcoin when the jamcoin is interpreted in base i+1.</p>
					<p>All of these jamcoins must be different. You cannot submit the same jamcoin in two different lines, even if you use a different set of divisors each time.</p>
					<h3>Limits</h3>
					<p><strong>T</strong> = 1. (There will be only one test case.)<br /> It is guaranteed that at least <strong>J</strong> distinct jamcoins of length <strong>N</strong> exist.</p>
					<h4>Small dataset</h4>
					<p><strong>N</strong> = 16.<br /> <strong>J</strong> = 50.</p>
					<h4>Large dataset</h4>
					<p><strong>N</strong> = 32.<br /> <strong>J</strong> = 500.</p>
					<p>Note that, unusually for a Code Jam problem, you already know the exact contents of each input file. For example, the Small dataset's input file will always be exactly these two lines:</p>
					<p><code> 1<br /> 16 50<br /> </code></p>
					<p>So, you can consider doing some computation before actually downloading an input file and starting the clock.</p>

					<p>In this sample case, we have used very small values of <strong>N</strong> and <strong>J</strong> for ease of explanation. Note that this sample case would not appear in either the Small or Large datasets.</p>
					<p>This is only one of multiple valid solutions. Other sets of jamcoins could have been used, and there are many other possible sets of nontrivial base 10 divisors. Some notes:</p>
					<ul>
					<li><code>110111</code> could not have been included in the output because, for example, it is 337 if interpreted in base 3 (1*243 + 1*81 + 0*27 + 1*9 + 1*3 + 1*1), and 337 is prime.</li>
					<li><code>010101</code> could not have been included in the output even though <code>10101</code> is a jamcoin, because jamcoins begin with <code>1</code>.</li>
					<li><code>101010</code> could not have been included in the output, because jamcoins end with <code>1</code>.</li>
					<li><code>110011</code> is another jamcoin that could have also been used in the output, but could not have been added to the end of this output, since the output must contain exactly <strong>J</strong> examples.</li>
					<li>For the first jamcoin in the sample output, the first number after <code>100011</code> could not have been either 1 or 35, because those are trivial divisors of 35 (<code>100011</code> in base 2).</li>
					</ul>
